# tdb-project-1: Event & Hotel API search

This Project will query an event & hotel API that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

It will use the [SeatGeek API](https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events) to retrieve event data in the postal-code area for a given date and description.
It will use the [Best Booking API](https://best-booking-com-hotel.p.rapidapi.com/booking/best-accommodation) from Rapid API to retrieve the recommended hotel in the area. The documentation of each API includes some examples.
It will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an event dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for events

WHEN I leave an input field blank
THEN I see results without the blank field filter applied
WHEN I click the find-hotel column next to an event
THEN I am presented with the recommended hotel in the area with the hotel-name, hotel-rating, hotel-price(if available), and hotel-website
WHEN I click the hotel website URL
THEN I redirected to the hotel website so I can book a reservation
